# pima-indians-diabetes-analysis
Logistic regression to model the "Pima Indians Diabetes" data set.

- This model will predict which people are likely to develop diabetes.  
- This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
